# Data Analysis

This contains code and data for chapter 7, Data Analysis, of *The Clojure Data
Analysis Cookbook* by Eric Rochester.

## Dependencies

To use this, you need to have [Leiningen
2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed.

Leiningen will take care of downloading the remaining dependencies:

> lein deps

## Usage

Once that's installed, you can run the code by running the specs:

> lein spec

However, most of the code is in the `src` directory. The parts to run are
usually in comments, and the functions defined are alongside those.
